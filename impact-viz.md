# Creating Compelling Research Impact Visualization

The ability to create effective visualizations of your research impact is a valuable skill when competing for grants, awards, and attention in a crowded research landscape. In this hands-on workshop, participants will create simple, eye-catching graphics to communicate impact from a variety of perspectives (from citation rates to collaboration networks to media attention).

Participants will learn how to: 
- Generate ready-made impact visualizations within a variety of bibliometric tools at McMaster. 
- Utilize raw bibliometric data and custom templates to create effective visualizations using Excel.  
- Effectively incorporate research impact visualizations into reports, grant applications, and award nominations.
